# Week 2 Server Checklist

## Setup
- [ ] Install project dependencies.
- [ ] Create `.env.dev` by copying `.env.example` and adjust the configuration values.

## Project Understanding
- [ ] Review how routes, controllers, and the database layer connect within the project structure.

## Data Layer & Controllers
- [ ] Implement the Sequelize ingredient model in `database-helper.js`.
- [ ] Complete controller logic so the `/ingredients` GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints work as described.

## Environments & Seeding
- [ ] Add a dedicated test environment that uses SQLite's in-memory database.
- [ ] Provide a seeding method that populates data when the application runs in test mode.
