# Week 1 Server Checklist

- [ ] Define the workout routine REST endpoints and expected behaviours in `routes/workout.js`.
- [ ] Enforce validation rules (existing IDs, unique names, at least one exercise, correct status codes) across CRUD operations.
- [ ] Implement automated tests in `tests/workout.test.js` that cover successful flows and the required error handling.
