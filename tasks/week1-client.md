# Week 1 Client Checklist

- [ ] Install project dependencies so the XMLHttpRequest-based starter template can run in Node.js.
- [ ] Implement `fetchWithCallbacks(url, cb)` using the error-first callback convention and verify it with valid and invalid URLs.
- [ ] Implement `fetchWithPromise(url)` that resolves or rejects based on request success and test both success and failure paths.
- [ ] Consume the promise-based helper with async/await to confirm the asynchronous workflow behaves as expected.
