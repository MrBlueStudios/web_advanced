# Shopping list App

This project is the result of the client exercise from last week.
The shopping list is only a single component. It is up to you to split it up into smaller, working components. 

make sure to install the dependencies with `npm install` or `npm i`.
You can then start the development server from the terminal with `npm run dev`.

After you split up the single component:
- It should be possible to add items to the shopping list.
- If there are no items on the list, the application should let the user know.
- It should be possible to delete items from the list

## Extra
Once you completed these instruction you can try to
- Add items when pressing the `Enter` key instead of pressing the add button.
- Make the item editable in place when double clicked.
